<p> None of this would have been possible without the invaluable support of my primary supervisor, Dr. Ralitsa Madsen, to whom I am profoundly grateful. 
<br> Thank you, Dr. Madsen, for believing in me and granting me the opportunity to undertake this project in your lab. <br> 

<br> I am also deeply appreciative of the individuals Dr. Madsen introduced me to; their guidance has been indispensable from the conception of this project to its completion (though it is not quite done!) <br>
<br> Dr. Sohini Chakraborti, for introducing me to the fundamentals of computational biology and supervising me during the Summer of '24.
<br> Dr. James Krieger, for patiently answering my many questions on the analytical techniques of MD simulations.
<br> Prof. Andrei Pisliakov, for allowing me to join his physics students during weekly lab meetings and providing access to his lab group's cluster.
<br> Prof. Alessio Ciulli, for his encouragement and support in ensuring the smooth progression of the project.

There are many others who have contributed to this project, and I am deeply grateful to all of them. <br>
I have learned so much throughout this journey, and I am incredibly thankful for the opportunity to work with and learn from such brilliant scientists.
